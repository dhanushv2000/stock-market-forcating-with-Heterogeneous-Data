# Stock Market Forcating With Heterogeneous Data

The objective of this project work is to develop an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) based on an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Model) to forecast the movement of stock volatility. We have analyzed various fields related to a stock market by giving our model various features as input and comparing it with the original trend of the stock market. In addition to this, the system uses heterogeneous data from carefully selected social media networks, as well as news headlines taken from official newspapers to analyze the mood of the public. In comparison to traditional transaction stock price predictions, public mood results are used as an influencer to forecast a better outcome.
