# stock-market-forcating-with-Heterogeneous-Data

The objectives of this project work is to develop
a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) based on a LSTM (Long
Short Term Memory Model) to forecast the movement of stock
volatility. We have analysed various fields related to a stock
market by giving our model various features as input and
comparing it with the original trend of the stock market. These
features includes heterogeneous data from carefully selected
social media networks to analyze the public mood along with the
news headlines extracted from official news papers to analyse the
public mood. These public mood results are used as an influential
feature in order to forecast a better outcome then traditional
transaction stock price prediction
